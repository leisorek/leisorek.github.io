                    <h1>President</h1>
                    <p>I had the honor of becoming the Student Government my Junior year. This was the first time that this had ever happened and now going into senior year I have the pleasure of becoming president again, so I am very excited. I think that this is a great accomplishment because I have had the honor to work with many people a school, meet lots of people outside of school, but most importantly I was able to make a difference at school. </p>

                    <h1>Hurricane Harvey</h1>
                    <p>In early September of 2017, I remember reading and hearing about the hurricane that was going through Houston and that's when I talked to Eitan my friend and I told him that we should go over there and help the people in Houston out. He decided to talk to his rabbi about it and suddenly 4 days later, on a Thursday while I was at school for back to school night, I get a call from him telling me that we are leaving for Houston Sunday morning. I packed up and we went to Houston to help out with whatever they needed.</p>

                  <h1>Fundacion Musset</h1>
                    <p>In September of 2017, I was flying to Mexico City, as usual, to visit my family and be with them for the Jewish holidays. But then a couple of days before I left Mexico City was hit with a huge earthquake that destroyed the city. So instead of staying in San Diego and being scared my family and I decided to still go to Mexico and help out. So I had the honor of helping out at a distribution center, that I helped start and after only 48 hours we were one of the most popular centers in Mexico.</p>

                    <h1>KEN</h1>
                    <p>I have been going to KEN ever since I can remember, KEN is a Mexican Jewish community in which we meet every Saturday to teach kids about the Jewish traditions and make friendships that will never be lost. For me being a counselor at KEN is a very important thing that I think is an accomplishment because you have the honor of teaching the younger generations about yourself, the Jewish people and even about themselves. So I think that we are a very important part of their lives, just like they are to mine.</p>
