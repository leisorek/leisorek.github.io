                    <h1>Football</h1>
                    <p>I started playing football when I was 9 years old, I played for only 2 years and then quit. Then I came into the Jewish Academy and really wanted to play again but my parents didn't let me. Sophomore year I finally convinced them into letting me play and it was the best time of my life. I play wide receiver and Corner Back and I love it. I not only love the sport itself but also the friendships and memories you make as a family.</p>

                    <h1>Soccer</h1>
                    <p>I have been playing soccer since I was 4 years old. Ever since I can remember it has always been to wake up early on Saturday mornings to go to my soccer games, rush to KEN and then leaving KEN early to go to my next game. I love soccer and although it is very different than Football it will forever be the sport that I grew up playing, watching and bonding over with my friends and family.</p>

                    <h1>Friends</h1>
                    <p>I have had the same friends my whole life, thanks to KEN. One of the many things KEN gives us are friends for life, which I have been honored to be able to have. These friends are my closest friends and I know I can always count on them. No matter if it's good or bad I know that they will always be there for me, no matter what. This is a picture of us at Coachella this year, which was not only a great experience for me but as a group, we grew together.</p>

                    <h1>Family</h1>
                    <p>Although I love my friends, my family will forever be number 1. For me family is everything, I know that they will truly always be there for me. They go through the same problems I do and I truly know that if I ever need anything from anyone they will always be the first t help. Although we do fight we have the best times together when we go on vacations.</p>
